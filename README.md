Breakdown of Project Tasks and Responsibilities:



Amreen Shahid

for the previews milestone, Amreen handled the MVC part of the project. She used Java events and made sure the model, view, and controller were separated and worked smoothly together. For the current milestone, For the current milestone, Amreen worked on the Uno Flip features for this milestone. She added the Flip card, Draw Five, Skip Everyone, and Wild Draw Colour. She also updated the scoring so it follows the Uno Flip rules. All the changes needed for the Flip mechanics were done by her.

Marc Aoun

for the previews milestone, Marc prepared the README, added JavaDocs, comments and completed the UML class diagram and the sequence diagrams. for current milestone, Marc worked on the AI player features for this milestone. He added the option to choose between human players and AI players, and he made sure the AI only plays legal cards. He also set up strategy so the AI makes moves that make sense within the context of game state. Marc also checked that the game still runs properly when playing with 1 human and 3 AI players. Marc updated the class diagrams and created the two required sequence diagrams: one for a human using a Flip card and one for the AI taking its turn.

Iman Elabd 

for the previews milestone, Iman was responsibe for testings cross classes and methods, ensuring the game ran smoothly. general code quality by improving synchronization between components, refining error handling, and expanding JUnit test coverage for model behavior and game logic. for current milestone, Iman continued doing JUnit testing for this milestone, she added JUnit tests for Uno Flip cards and tested the AI player actions. Ensured everything running smoothly. Iman prepared the README for this milestone, added JavaDocs, comments. 


Breakdown of other deliverables: Our project is split into four milestones. Milestone 1 was the text-based game of Uno. Milestone 2 added the full GUI and model testing. Milestone 3 focused on Uno Flip and the AI players. Milestone 4 includes the undo/redo feature and saving and loading the game

for every milestone, we update the code, add new tests, fix the UML diagrams, update our documentation, and write a README that explains what changed and who worked on what. Each milestone is submitted as one zip file with everything included.

Known issues: we did encountered an issue with AI wild stack card, and a possible fix would be simplifying the Wild Stack logic so the AI can follow it correctly.
